# Knights Travails
### The Odin Project: JavaScript Course
### [Project: Knights Travails](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/javascript-knights-travails)

A project that uses <b>Breadth First Search</b> algorithm to determine the shortest path a Chess Knight will take from a square to another square on a chess board.

For example, from coordinate (0,0) to (3,3):

        knightMoves([0,0],[3,3]);
Console will print:

        You made it in 2 moves! Here's your path:
        [ 0, 0 ]
        [ 2, 1 ]
        [ 3, 3 ]

### Instruction:
1. To run the program inside the terminal, make sure Node.js is installed in your system
2. Enter the line below into the terminal to run <b><i>index.js</i></b>:

        node [path to file]
    If the current directory is the same as the files:

        node index.js
